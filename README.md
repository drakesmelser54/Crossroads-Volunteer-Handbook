# Crossroads Volunteer Handbook

## Mission

To help gamify and improve the onboarding process volunteers face when onboarding for Crossroads, this SPA will make complex domestic violence info much more palatable and easy to learn. 

## How it works?

The online Volunteer Handbook will work as an online lesson to teach volunteers about the everything from the history of Crossroads, to domestic violence info, and ultimately how a volunteer can help the victims while on-site. 

## Confidentiality

To protect domestic violence victims, no mention of location, people involved, or any incriminating info will be used in this site. In addition, users must have a login approved by the volunteer coordinator to undergo the lesson.

## Collaborators 

My wife and I created this site. It is a non-profit project for Crossroads.
