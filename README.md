# Crossroads Volunteer Handbook

## Mission
Helping a mildewing thick stack of pages that once resembled a volunteer-handbook evovle to the modern age. This virtual handbook serves as an onboarding tool for volunteers at a local non-profit. It takes complex and undigestable content and presents it in a palatble way. 

## How it works?

The online Volunteer Handbook will work as an online lesson to teach volunteers about the everything from the history of Crossroads, to domestic violence info, and ultimately how a volunteer can help the victims while on-site. Users create a log-in, allowing them to track and save their progress. Once a user completes all of the lessons in the handbook, they fill out an exit form that congratulates them on their experience and informs the non-profit's volunteer coordinator. 


## What was used?

The Crossroads Volunteer Handbook is a Vanilla JS Project. Basic HTML and CSS (Non-Bootstrap) were used. Google Firebase was used for Auth and DB purposes. And Form Spree was used for any outgoing forms. The content was created and curated by the non-profits volunteer coordinator.


## Confidentiality

To protect domestic violence victims, no mention of location, people involved, or any incriminating info will be used in this site. In addition, users must have a login approved by the volunteer coordinator to undergo the lesson.

## Collaborators 

This is a non-profit project for Crossroads Rhode Island. I was the sole dev who built this site. The volunteer coordinator for Crossroads created and designed all of the content. Extensive code review was done by Zack Krida (@zackkrdia). This project would not have been completly functional without his insight and skill!
