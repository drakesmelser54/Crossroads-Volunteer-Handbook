The visitor may just be at the wrong location.</li>
          <li>If you sense that the individual is trying to come in or gain information about a resident you must inform the individual that you cannot confirm or deny that that person is or is not here and ask that the visitor leave.

Immediately call/notify staff if an incident like this occurs.</li>
