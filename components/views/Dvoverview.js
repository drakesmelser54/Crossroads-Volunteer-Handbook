      <p>Emotional and psychological abuse is every bit as hurtful and scarring as physical abuse and often more difficult to identify.Emotional abuse may be defined as any behavior (usually verbal) that exploits another person’s vulnerability, insecurity, or character.</p>
      <p>Types of emotional and psychological abuse include tactics of isolation, verbal attacks, insults, jokes about another’s flaws, name-calling, put-downs and accusations of affairs.

      <p>Sexual abuse is defined as any non-consenting sexually exploitative behavior. These behaviors may be verbal and/or physical.

In addition, children under the age 16 cannot legally give consent to sexual activities.</p>

       <p>The Power & Control diagram is a particularly helpful tool in understanding the overall pattern of abusive and violent behaviors, which are used by a batterer to establish and maintain control over his partner. Very often, one or more violent incidents are accompanied by an array of these other types of abuse. They are less easily identified, yet firmly establish a pattern of intimidation and control in the relationship.</p>
