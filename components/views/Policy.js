    <h2>Sexual Harassment</h2>
  <button class="accordion">Definition</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <p>It is the policy of Crossroad Rhode Island that no employee, volunteer, or intern may sexually harass any employee. This policy not only applies to employees, but also to other individuals of organizations with whom we have business relationships or who are functioning under the agency’s control or who are served by Crossroads Rhode Island. This includes, but is not limited to, contractors and other non-employees on our work premises. Sexual harassment is a form of unlawful discrimination and is therefore prohibited. Any employee, volunteer, or intern will be subject to disciplinary action for violation of this policy.
      <br></br>
      Sexual harassment is illegal under both state and federal law. It is also unlawful and a violation of this policy to retaliate against an employee , volunteer, or intern for filing a complaint of sexual harassment or for cooperating in an investigation of sexual harassment. In some cases, sexual harassment may be subject to persecution under criminal law. Crossroads Rhode Island will take strong responsive action to violations of this policy. Sanctions for harassment by employees, volunteers, or interns may include the full range of disciplinary actions up to and including termination of employment.
      <br></br>
      All employees, volunteers, and interns are encouraged to promptly report any behavior perceived as harassment, which the agency will then investigate. It is the behavior and not the intention that will be evaluated. Any employee/volunteer/intern found in violation of the agency’s policy regarding harassment would be subject to disciplinary action. The disciplinary action taken will depend on the circumstances surrounding the incident.
      <br></br>
      Retaliation against an employee/volunteer/intern for filing a complaint of sexual harassment in good faith, or cooperating in an investigation of such complaint is unlawful and will not be tolerated.</p>

    <button class="accordion">Procedure</button>
    <div class="panel">
      <ul>
        <li> An employee/ volunteer/ intern who believes that they are being harassed should promptly report the alleged sexual harassment to their manager.

In the event the complaint is with the Human Resources Department, the complaint may be made directly to the President of Crossroads.</li>
        <li>Manager/Person Receiving Complaint and Human Resources Responsibility:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Individuals receiving a complaint of sexual harassment must give prompt attention to that complaint by immediately notifying Human Resources.</li>
