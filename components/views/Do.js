    <h3>Residential Program</h3>
    <h4>The Domestic Violence Program’s facility allows each family its own room as well as space for group meetings. Single women may share a room. When residents enter the program, they receive the basic needs of shelter, food, clothing and safety. In addition, a case manager assists each woman in working on her goals. These may include finding an apartment, medical and legal concerns, establishing a means of income, returning to school, and getting or keeping a job. Clients attend groups aimed at helping them express their feelings in a healthy way and heal from their experiences. The Family Advocate works with each child and meets with the mother to identify needs and set goals. Residents can stay with us from one to three months. </h4>

    <h3>Transition Program</h3>
    <h4>The goal of the Transitional Program is to offer services and support to women while they progress to more independent lives. Residents seeking to re-enter the workforce, upgrade their current situation, or further their education, receive help with career development plans, educational options, writing resumes, completing financial aid forms for college/continuing education, and referrals to outside vocational and educational programs.<br></br>
    Clients learn and actively practice the skills necessary for independent living in their community, including finding housing and running a household, accessing medical or mental health services, finding help in a crisis or emergency, getting and holding a job, completing education, and improving parenting skills. The program continues to help victimized women to develop their sense of self-worth and self-confidence while helping them achieve their full potential by gradually widening their relational circles with families, peers and community resources.</h4>

    <h3>Child Enrichment Program</h3>
    <h4>The goal of the Children's Enrichment Program is to create a safe, supportive learning environment for residential children to enhance their social, emotional, cognitive, physical, and linguistic development. Research has demonstrated that it is extremely important to effectively and therapeutically address the experience of interpersonal family violence in children. It has established that it is necessary to help children understand and cope with their emotional responses to the violence, while promoting their acquisition of positive behavior patterns. To address these issues, the Family Advocate and volunteers focus on developing social skills, coping strategies, expressing emotions, conflict resolution, self-esteem, and healthy relationships.
